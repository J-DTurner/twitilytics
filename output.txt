TASK COMPLETED: Modified /backend/routes/payment.js

Changes implemented:

1. ✅ Enhanced create-checkout route (/api/payment/create-checkout):
   - Added frontendBaseUrl variable to safely access process.env.FRONTEND_URL
   - Added explicit check for missing FRONTEND_URL environment variable
   - Added critical error logging when FRONTEND_URL is not set
   - Returns clear 500 error response: "Payment service is misconfigured (URL). Please contact support."
   - Updated successUrl and cancelUrl to use frontendBaseUrl variable

2. ✅ Enhanced create-scrape-checkout route (/api/payment/create-scrape-checkout):
   - Added frontendBaseUrl variable to safely access process.env.FRONTEND_URL
   - Added explicit check for missing FRONTEND_URL environment variable
   - Added critical error logging specifically for scrape checkout when FRONTEND_URL is not set
   - Returns clear 500 error response: "Scraping service payment is misconfigured (URL). Please contact support."
   - Updated successUrl and cancelUrl to use frontendBaseUrl variable

**Key improvements**:
- **Error prevention**: Explicit checks prevent undefined URLs from being passed to Polar
- **Clear diagnostics**: Critical error logging makes missing FRONTEND_URL immediately obvious
- **User-friendly errors**: Meaningful error messages for frontend when configuration is missing
- **Code clarity**: Using frontendBaseUrl variable improves readability
- **Consistent handling**: Both checkout routes now have identical FRONTEND_URL validation

**Environment variable requirement**:
The .env file must contain:
```
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8001  # for development
# or
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-production-frontend-url.com  # for production
```

This resolves the "Input should be a valid URL, relative URL without a base" error by ensuring FRONTEND_URL is properly defined before constructing Polar checkout URLs.

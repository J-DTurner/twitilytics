Task completed successfully. Verified that payment.js correctly passes the Price ID with the expected key structure.

Verification Results:
1. The `polarCheckoutParams` object in payment.js uses `product_price_id` as the key for the price ID (lines 62 and 371)
2. The CheckoutsAPI.create method (modified in Backend Step 1) correctly takes `params.product_price_id` and places it inside the `products` array
3. The parameter passing mechanism remains compatible between payment.js and the updated CheckoutsAPI.create method
4. No code changes are required in payment.js for this structural change

The integration between payment.js and checkouts.js is properly maintained after the Backend Step 1 modifications.

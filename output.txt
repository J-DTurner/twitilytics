Task completed successfully. Modified the /scrape-and-analyze route in backend/routes/analysis.js to implement critical backend security changes that verify the paymentSessionId and use parameters from Polar's metadata instead of blindly trusting client input.

Changes made:
1. Added Polar client imports:
   - getPolarClient from '../utils/polar/clientCache'
   - resolvePolarEnv from '../utils/polar/resolvePolarEnv'
   - PolarAPIError from '../utils/polar/errors'

2. Modified request validation:
   - paymentSessionId is now required (Polar's checkout session ID)
   - numBlocks is now optional for context only, will be overridden by verified metadata
   - Updated variable names for clarity (requestedHandle, requestedNumBlocks)

3. Implemented payment verification before scraping:
   - Uses paymentSessionId to fetch checkout session details from Polar
   - Checks if polarSession.status === 'succeeded' 
   - Extracts verifiedTwitterHandle, verifiedNumBlocks, and verifiedScrapeJobId from metadata
   - Validates all required parameters are present and valid
   - Compares requested handle with verified handle for security

4. Updated scraping logic to use verified parameters:
   - Uses verifiedTwitterHandle and verifiedNumBlocks for Apify searchTerms and maxItems
   - Adds verified parameters to processed data for context
   - Enhanced logging with verified parameters

5. Enhanced error handling:
   - Added specific handling for PolarAPIError (404 for session not found)
   - Improved error messages with specific payment status information
   - Added comprehensive logging for verification outcomes

6. Security improvements:
   - Prevents tampering by validating all scrape parameters come from verified Polar metadata
   - Logs mismatches between requested and verified parameters
   - Ensures only successful payments can trigger scraping

The route now securely verifies payment status and parameters through Polar before executing any scraping operations, preventing unauthorized or manipulated scrape requests.

Task completed successfully. Updated PaymentVerification.jsx to handle the {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID} placeholder by polling the new internal status endpoint.

Major changes made:

1. Added imports and constants:
   - Added useRef import for poll count tracking
   - Added verifyPaymentByInternalId import from paymentService
   - Added POLLING_INTERVAL (3 seconds) and MAX_POLLS (20 attempts = 1 minute) constants

2. Created processSuccessfulPayment helper function:
   - Extracted payment success logic to be reusable by both verification paths
   - Takes result and polarCheckoutId parameters
   - Handles both scrape and file upload data source updates
   - Clears localStorage and navigates to report

3. Added attemptVerification function:
   - Encapsulates normal Polar session ID verification flow
   - Uses existing verifyPaymentStatus service
   - Calls processSuccessfulPayment on success

4. Added pollInternalStatus function:
   - Implements polling mechanism for internal session ID verification
   - Sets appropriate status message for user feedback
   - Uses setInterval to poll every 3 seconds up to 20 times
   - Handles timeout, success, and failure scenarios
   - Logs each polling attempt for debugging
   - Stops polling on non-pending payment status

5. Updated main useEffect logic:
   - Extracts internalAnalysisSessionId from URL parameters
   - Detects {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID} placeholder
   - Routes to pollInternalStatus when placeholder detected
   - Falls back to normal verification for actual session IDs
   - Enhanced error handling for missing internal IDs

6. Enhanced URL parameter handling:
   - Uses data_session_id or customer_external_id as internal session ID
   - These parameters are reliably passed in success_url during checkout creation
   - Provides fallback verification when Polar's session_id is problematic

This implementation provides a robust fallback mechanism when Polar fails to replace the {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID} placeholder, using webhook-confirmed payment status stored in sessionManager to verify payments via internal session identifiers.

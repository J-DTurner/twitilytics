Task completed successfully. Modified FileUploadSection.jsx to remove showPaymentButton state and handleAnalyzeClick function. Added useEffect to update context when processing completes. Combined timeframe selector, email input, and payment button into single step that displays when file && isProcessed. Streamlined user flow by removing intermediate "Next" button.

Task completed successfully. Modified the error message in PaymentVerification.jsx when the literal placeholder {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID} is detected to provide more specific guidance to the user.

The error message was updated from:
"Received a placeholder session ID. Payment verification cannot proceed. This often indicates an issue with the payment provider redirect setup or that the redirect happened before the placeholder was replaced. Please contact support if your payment was successful."

To:
"Error: Invalid session identifier from payment provider. We received a placeholder value ('{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}') instead of an actual payment session ID. This can happen due to a temporary issue with the payment provider's redirect or if the redirect occurred too quickly. If your payment was successful, please contact support and provide them with this full URL: ${window.location.href}"

The enhanced error message now includes:
1. Clear explanation of the issue (placeholder value received instead of actual session ID)
2. Potential causes (temporary issue with payment provider redirect or redirect occurred too quickly)
3. Instructions for user to contact support with the full URL containing all parameters

This enhanced error message will help users understand the issue and provide support teams with the necessary debugging information including the full URL with the unreplaced placeholder and other parameters.

TASK COMPLETED: Reviewed PaymentVerification.jsx and TweetDataContext.jsx

Assessment of both files:

1. ✅ **PaymentVerification.jsx**:
   - Already correctly configured for Polar payment system
   - Properly retrieves session_id from URL (Polar checkout session ID)
   - Calls verifyPaymentStatus(sessionId) which communicates with backend
   - Correctly updates paid status with updatePaidStatus(true, sessionId)
   - Properly handles both file upload and scrape payment flows via metadata analysis
   - updateDataSource calls are appropriate for linking payment to analysis type
   - No changes required - component is already properly structured for single payment flow

2. ✅ **TweetDataContext.jsx**:
   - No credit-related states or functions found (userCredits, updateUserCredits, etc.)
   - Contains only appropriate payment states: isPaidUser and paymentSessionId
   - updatePaidStatus function correctly manages single payment status
   - Context is properly structured for managing paid state of current analysis
   - No credit-related logic to remove - already clean

**Key findings**:
- Both components are already correctly implemented for Polar's single payment model
- No credit system remnants found that need removal
- Payment verification flow properly links Polar session IDs to analysis sessions
- Context state management is appropriate for single payment per analysis model
- Frontend responsibility correctly focused on setting isPaidUser flag for current analysis

**Result**: No code modifications required - both files are already properly configured for the Polar payment system without any credit-related logic.

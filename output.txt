Task Completed: Modified faq-section.css to ensure "+" / "−" text icon is correctly centered

Changes made to /mnt/host/c/Users/Administrator/Documents/twitilytics/frontend/src/styles/faq-section.css:

1. Enhanced the CSS rule for `.faq-toggle` to add `line-height: 1;` property
2. Added explicit comments for the existing flex centering properties to clarify their purpose
3. The `line-height: 1;` ensures that the text node itself has minimal intrinsic height, allowing flex centering to position the "+" or "−" character more precisely within the button's fixed dimensions

The modifications ensure that the toggle button text icons are perfectly centered both vertically and horizontally by combining flexbox properties with optimized line-height for single character display.

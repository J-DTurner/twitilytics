Task completed: Modified .replit deployment configuration for optimized production deployment

Changed from:
[deployment]
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run dev"]

To:
[deployment]
build = "npm run build"
run = "npm start"

Changes made:
- Added build = "npm run build" to execute frontend build during deployment
- Changed run to "npm start" to use production start script instead of development script

This provides a more standard and optimized deployment process that builds the frontend and runs the production server.

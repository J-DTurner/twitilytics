Task Completion: FileUploadSection Component Migration to Fixed Polar Packages

Successfully updated the FileUploadSection.jsx component to handle fixed Polar packages instead of dynamic pricing:

Key Changes Made:

1. Package Configuration:
   - Removed: numBlocks state variable and SCRAPE_COST_PER_BLOCK constant
   - Added: SCRAPE_PACKAGE_BLOCKS = 5 (for 5000 tweets)
   - Added: SCRAPE_PACKAGE_COST = 10.00 (fixed package price)

2. UI Updates for Scrape Form:
   - Removed: Dynamic numBlocks selector dropdown with variable pricing
   - Added: Fixed package display showing "Standard Scrape (5,000 tweets)"
   - Added: Descriptive text explaining the package analyzes up to 5,000 recent tweets
   - Updated: Button text to show fixed package cost ($10.00) instead of dynamic pricing

3. Handler Function Updates:
   - handleScrapeAndPay(): Now uses SCRAPE_PACKAGE_BLOCKS instead of numBlocks state
   - Payment handler call now passes fixed numBlocks: SCRAPE_PACKAGE_BLOCKS
   - updateDataSource() call updated to use fixed SCRAPE_PACKAGE_BLOCKS

4. Payment Processing Updates:
   - Updated payment notes to use generic "Secure payment processing" instead of "Stripe"
   - Maintained 100% Money-Back Guarantee messaging
   - Both file upload and scrape payment sections now have consistent payment messaging

5. Form Structure Changes:
   - Replaced interactive numBlocks selection with informational package display
   - Maintained Twitter handle and email input fields
   - Simplified user experience by removing pricing complexity
   - Clear package description helps users understand what they're purchasing

The updated component now aligns with Polar's fixed package pricing model while maintaining a clean user experience. Users see exactly what they get (5,000 tweets for $10.00) without the complexity of dynamic pricing selection. The component properly passes the fixed package parameters to the payment handler, which will create the appropriate Polar checkout session.

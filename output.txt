Task completed successfully. Adjusted the useEffect hook in PaymentVerification.jsx to handle the {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID} placeholder more gracefully.

Key changes made:

1. Updated state management:
   - Added intervalIdRef to store interval ID for proper cleanup
   - Modified processSuccessfulPayment to explicitly set verifying to false

2. Enhanced placeholder handling:
   - When polarCheckoutSessionIdFromUrl === '{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}', the component now:
     - Sets statusMessage to "Finalizing payment confirmation... This may take a moment."
     - Explicitly sets error to null (clearing any previous errors)
     - Keeps verifying state as true to show spinner
     - Does NOT immediately set an error state

3. Improved polling function (startPollingInternalStatus):
   - Sets proper status message for user feedback during polling
   - Clears any previous errors before starting
   - Only sets error state on timeout or definitive payment failure
   - Enhanced logging for better debugging

4. Added cleanup functionality:
   - useEffect now returns cleanup function to clear intervals on unmount
   - Prevents memory leaks if component unmounts during polling

5. Better variable naming:
   - Renamed internalAnalysisSessionId to internalIdFromUrl for clarity
   - More descriptive function names (attemptDirectVerification, startPollingInternalStatus)

6. Enhanced error handling:
   - Errors are only set when polling times out or returns definitive failure
   - More user-friendly error messages with specific guidance
   - Better distinction between timeout and payment failure scenarios

This implementation provides a smoother user experience when Polar fails to replace the placeholder, showing a loading state instead of an immediate error while the system attempts to verify payment through internal polling.

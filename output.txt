Task completed successfully. Enhanced PaymentVerification.jsx with comprehensive logging to detect if the literal placeholder {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID} is being received from Polar's redirect.

Changes made:
1. Added console.group logging block at the beginning of useEffect to capture all URL parameters:
   - Raw polarCheckoutSessionId from URL
   - Source Type from URL  
   - Analysis Type from URL
   - Analysis Session ID (data_session_id) from URL
   - Customer External ID (customer_external_id) from URL
   - All Search Params Object (complete overview)

2. Added explicit check for literal placeholder string:
   - Detects if polarCheckoutSessionId === '{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}'
   - Logs critical error to console when placeholder is detected
   - Sets informative error message explaining the issue and advising user to contact support
   - Stops verification process early to prevent further errors

3. Enhanced verification flow logging:
   - Logs backend verification result
   - Logs metadata from Polar on successful payment
   - Logs determined serviceType
   - Logs scrape analysis details (handle, blocks, scrapeJobID)
   - Logs file analysis details (dataSessionID)
   - Enhanced error logging with searchParams context
   - Logs localStorage cleanup actions

4. Improved error display:
   - Added prominent error message display in JSX
   - Enhanced error states with detailed user-facing messages
   - Includes Polar Session ID in error messages for support

The enhanced logging will clearly identify whether the frontend is receiving the literal placeholder from Polar's redirect and provide comprehensive debugging information for the payment verification flow.
